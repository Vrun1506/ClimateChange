<font color="#00008b"><font size="3">In summary, I would like to conclude that without relentless activists like Greta Thunberg, we may have been heading in the wrong. It is thanks to her that we have become aware of the current situation so in short, her campaign has been a success as well as the current climate's unpredictability. Ever since this thing about climate change has been looming around, scientists have started looking for other planets in space that can support human life, though all of the missions have been unsuccessful so far despite the fact that we have had a few close calls. We wouldn't have ended up in this present situation if we had taken care of our planet earlier. With a bit of luck,we will make it in time to rescue our planet by planting more trees and going as green as we can. Hopefully, we wouldn't have to use the carbon capture machine to save our planet. If we continue in the path that we are travelling, it will make the probability of our planet ending 100% certain.
