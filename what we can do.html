<br>
<br>
<font color="#00008b"><font size="3">As we release more carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by carrying out high emitting activities like using fossil fuels to power our homes for electricity instead of environmental friendly solar panels or wind turbines, we are creating a greater greenhouse effect which is the reason why our planet is slowly warming up.
<br>
<br>
 <font color="#00008b">As a last minute emergency, scientists have created a carbon-capture machine that can capture up to 90% of the carbon in the stratosphere and beyond so that all of the Sun's gamma and alpha radiation can be re-emitted out of the atmosphere. However, instead of relying on this backup, the thing we should be doing is planting more trees. Like I mentioned in one of my earlier pages, the Amazon Rainforest is burning down due to this. Life on Earth will no longer be alive because there will be no oxygen for us to breathe. So in short, we need to replace and replant more trees so that we can avoid this specimen that has been caused by humans.
