<br>
<font size="3"><font color="#FF0000">The definition of global warming ,according to the Oxford dictionary definition, is a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, CFCs, and other pollutants. Global warming has affected everyone in some way or another, be it from the higher risk of natural disasters to the bleaching of the corals in the Great Barrier Reef due to the increase in temperature in seas.
<br>
<br>
Some of the major effects include:
<li>the melting of glaciers
<li>the rise in sea levels
<li>cloud forests are dying
<li>the "lungs" of the world are getting burnt down.
<br>
<br>
Recently in the news, one of the main headlines was the Amazon Rainforest,the lungs of the world, were getting burnt down due to the corrupt Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, allowing indigenous people and farmers to burn down the forests for more land. The French president, Emmanuel Macron offered his condolences and offered him a multi-million dollar cash sum to get the resources required to end and destroy all of the wildfires. However, instead of agreeing with his help, he only went and insulted the European countries by saying that they think that they can solve any problem when they throw money at it even if the reality is different-a typical sign of politics in the capitalist world . The G7 summit that was being held at that time consisting of the 7 richest world leaders in the world including our ex-prime minister, Theresa May. They discussed on the topic of the burning of the Amazon Rainforest and all eventually agreed to pay a large sum of money to control these wildfires through an extremely large impasse created between the G7 leaders and the Brazilian president.
