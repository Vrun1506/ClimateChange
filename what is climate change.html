<font size="3"><font color="#ffdd00"><font-family="arial">According to the Dictionary.com definition, climate change is a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels due to the actions of humans.

<br>
<font size="3"><font color="#ffdd00">Since records began, the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been rising, as shown in the graph below:

<br>
The graph shows that the 300 parts per million wasn't crossed until 1950 and the level is still rising. The graph shows a constantly fluctuating line. However, the slope continued to rise as the resources were more abundant, for example fossil fuels like coal. During the Industrial Revolution, we found an abundance of coal underground where we found out that when it is burned, it produces a lot of thermal energy which couldbe used to power stuff up.
